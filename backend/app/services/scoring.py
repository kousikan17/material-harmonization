"""
Explainable weighted similarity scoring (spec section 6-9).

Every comparison between two CPSE materials produces a set of independently
inspectable 0-100 component scores plus a final weighted score, so the
frontend "why did AI match these materials?" panel can always show a
human-readable breakdown - nothing here is a black box. Material identity
considers more than description text: type, grade, dimensions,
specification, UOM, manufacturer (when technically critical), standard,
function and criticality all contribute (spec section 6). Packaging/pack
size is deliberately never a component here - it must never make two
otherwise-identical materials look different (spec section 6 example).
